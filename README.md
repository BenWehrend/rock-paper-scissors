### Learning Goals:
- Solidify and demonstrate your understanding of:
- DRY JavaScript
- event delegation to handle similar event listeners
- Understand the difference between the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM
- Use your problem solving process to break down large problems, solve things step by step, and trust an outside “answer” to a logical challenge

### Win & Challenges
Wins: making 2 simple interactive games that keep score.

Challenges: figuring out how to make a rock, paper, scissors game from scratch.
